WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

This OCMOD has the functionality to adapt the compatibility of some modules (payments and shipping) developed for Opencart 2.2.x so that it works in the current version, which is 2.3.x without having to change anything in the structure or code.

Has this module been tested?

I tested in some payment modules of my own development, I recommend always testing in stores that are not in production and checking the operation.

HOW TO INSTALL

1 - Send the ocmod xml file into the system / directory of your Opencart 2.3.x.

2 - Go to admin> modifications and in the upper right corner click reload modifications.

3 - After successfully reloaded just try to install your opencart 2.2.x modules in your 2.3.x and test.

YOUR CONTRIBUTION IS WELCOME
